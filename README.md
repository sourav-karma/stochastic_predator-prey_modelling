# stochastic_predator-prey_modelling
In Nigeria, livestock grazing, particularly by Fulani herdsmen, is crucial for food and livelihoods, with almost half of the country's protein demand reliant on beef. However, there's a spatial variability in cattle production, with 97% of production in the north and a significant market in the south. The seasonal migration of Fulani herdsmen to southern regions during dry seasons leads to conflicts with local farmers due to overgrazing and crop destruction. Severe climatic pressures in the north exacerbate this migration. To address these challenges, a model is proposed to estimate sustainable grazing durations and carrying capacities of southern lands, aiding policymakers in implementing sustainable resource management practices.
The aim of this model is to examine the temporal relationship between the grassland and the cattle in Enugu State (South-eastern Nigeria) and to estimate the carrying capacity of the system. To achieve this aim, the following objectives will be applied---

● Estimate the total grassland coverage of the study area

● Understand the complexity of the prey and predator biology (growth, consumption, biomass, etc.) to estimate model parameters

● Model the system to show the relationship between the two organisms in the ecosystem
